CHANGELOG 02/03/2017:

Velocity:
-> Changed isValidVelocity() to instance method canHaveAsVelocity() 

-> Set variable speedLimit to default value 300000 (however this will 
	change in future versions when ships can have diffent speed limits, 
	therefore instance method setSpeedLimit() is already implemented in this version).

-> Changed 	public boolean canHaveAsVelocity() {
			return (this.getSpeed() <= 300000);
	to:
		public boolean canHaveAsVelocity() {
			return (this.getSpeed() <= speedLimit);
	
	for the sake of adaptebility (see previous log entry).

-> Minor changes to method headers.

-> Put		@invar The speed of a ship can never be higher than c = 300 000 km/s.
  			| canHaveAsVelocity(getVelocity())
	
	as class invariant for the class Velocity.
	? Should it be removed as class invariant for the class Ship?

Position:
-> Changed isValidPosition() to instance method canHaveAsPosition(). 

-> Class Position, line 34: double cannot be compared to null => RETHINK THIS METHOD'S
	IMPLEMENTATION.

-> Made class IllegalTimeException in package src/asteroids.exceptions => tried to extend
	to ModelException => FAILED, no idea how to do this. 


NOTE: Assertions should be enabled when implementing nominal methods.
